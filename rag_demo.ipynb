    "# Backblaze B2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows you to build on a foundation model, that is, an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM), adding custom context that the model can use in interacting with a user. You can use RAG to implement chatbots that use your own proprietary data to answer questions, without that data leaking to the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through loading PDF files from [Backblaze B2 Cloud Object Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) into a [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) RAG app, then building a chatbot that can answer questions relating to the content of those PDF files. You'll use an open-source language model that you run locally, rather than an online API, ensuring that your data stays confidential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is based on the LangChain tutorial, [Build a Local RAG Application](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/local_rag/)."

It's useful to organize files by prefix (analogous to a folder or directory in a traditional filesystem); this example assumes the PDFs have the prefix `pdfs/` within the bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have any suitable PDF files to hand, you can [download a PDF of the Backblaze B2 documentation](https://metadaddy-langchain-demo.s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com/pdfs/documentation.pdf) and upload it to your own bucket. "

    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Backblaze B2 has an S3-compatible API, this notebook uses LangChain's [`S3FileLoader`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.s3_file.S3FileLoader.html) and the [`s3fs`](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module to interact with files in Backblaze B2, as well as the [AWS SDK for Python, also known as Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html). Both `S3FileLoader` and `s3fs` use Boto3 under the covers, so you need simply configure the latter so that all of the tools can access your Backblaze B2 Bucket. The most straightforward way to do so in this context is via environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you should never, *ever* put credentials in your code, including Jupyter notebooks! This example uses `python-dotenv` to load configuration from a `.env` file into environment variables for use by `S3FileLoader`. This repo includes a template file, `.env.template`. Copy it to `.env`, then edit it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dotenv\n",
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<Your Backblaze application key ID>'\n",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<Your Backblaze application key>'\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, `.env` should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dotenv\n",
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='004qlekmvpwemrt000000009e'\n",

The Master Application Key has full permissions and allows complete control over the entire account including all buckets and their contents. On the other hand, a Standard Application Key provides limited access and is suitable for granting specific permissions to third-party applications or services that need to interact with only one bucket without having access to the rest of your B2 cloud storage resources.\n",
